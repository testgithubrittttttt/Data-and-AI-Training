üîµ 1. SUPERVISED LEARNING
‚úÖ Definition:
Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on labeled data, i.e., each training example comes with an input-output pair.
The model learns to map inputs to outputs using this labeled data.

üéØ Goal:
To learn a function that, given a new input, predicts the correct output based on past examples.

üì¶ Data Requirements:
Labeled dataset: Input features (X) and corresponding output labels (Y).
Example: In spam detection, emails (X) are labeled as spam or not spam (Y).

üß† Algorithms:
Regression:
Linear Regression
Logistic Regression
Ridge/Lasso Regression

Classification:
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Decision Trees
Random Forests
k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
Neural Networks

üü¢ Examples:
Input	Output (Label)
Image of a cat	"Cat"
House features	House price
Email content	Spam / Not spam
Transaction data	Fraud / Legitimate

‚úÖ Pros:
Predictable performance.
Easy to evaluate (accuracy, precision, etc.).
Useful in many real-world applications.

‚ùå Cons:
Needs a lot of labeled data.
Manual labeling can be expensive and time-consuming.

üåç Use Cases:
Image classification (e.g., facial recognition)
Sentiment analysis
Medical diagnosis
Fraud detection
Weather forecasting

üß© Key Concepts:
Overfitting/Underfitting
Bias-Variance Tradeoff
Train/Test Split
Cross-Validation

üü£ 2. UNSUPERVISED LEARNING
‚úÖ Definition:
Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model learns patterns and structures in data without labels.
No predefined outputs; the algorithm must find hidden structure.

üéØ Goal:
To discover underlying patterns, groupings, or representations in data.

üì¶ Data Requirements:
Only input features, no labels.
Example: Clustering customers based on purchase behavior.

üß† Algorithms:
Clustering:
K-Means
DBSCAN
Hierarchical Clustering

Dimensionality Reduction:
PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
t-SNE
Autoencoders

Association Rules:
Apriori
FP-Growth

üü£ Examples:
Input Data	Discovered Pattern
Customer purchase history	Customer segments
Words in documents	Topics or clusters of similar documents
High-dimensional images	2D visualization of clusters

‚úÖ Pros:
No need for labeled data.
Can find unknown patterns.
Useful for pre-processing.

‚ùå Cons:
Hard to evaluate performance.
Results may be less interpretable.
Can find meaningless patterns if not used carefully.

üåç Use Cases:
Customer segmentation
Market basket analysis
Anomaly detection (e.g., fraud)
Recommendation systems
Dimensionality reduction for visualization

üß© Key Concepts:
Distance metrics (Euclidean, cosine, etc.)
Silhouette score (clustering quality)
Density vs centroid-based clustering

üü† 3. REINFORCEMENT LEARNING (RL)
‚úÖ Definition:
Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment to maximize cumulative reward.
No explicit labels; learning is based on trial and error.

üéØ Goal:
To learn a policy (strategy) that tells the agent the best action to take in a given state to maximize rewards over time.

üì¶ Data Requirements:
Environment with states, actions, and rewards.
Feedback is delayed and sparse.

üß† Algorithms:
Model-Free:
Q-Learning
Deep Q-Networks (DQN)
SARSA
Policy Gradient Methods:
REINFORCE
Actor-Critic

Model-Based:
Dyna-Q
AlphaZero (Monte Carlo Tree Search + RL)

üü† Examples:
State	Action	Reward
Game screen (e.g., Pong)	Move paddle up	+1 if hit ball
Robot location	Move forward	-1 if hit wall
Self-driving car state	Turn left	+10 for staying on road

‚úÖ Pros:
Can learn complex behaviors.
Good for sequential decision-making.
Works well in dynamic environments.

‚ùå Cons:
Computationally expensive.
Requires many interactions (episodes).
Hard to converge.
Risk of unsafe exploration.

üåç Use Cases:
Game playing (e.g., AlphaGo, Dota 2 bots)
Robotics
Autonomous vehicles
Inventory management
Recommender systems (contextual bandits)

üß© Key Concepts:
Agent, Environment
State, Action, Reward
Policy (œÄ)
Value Function (V), Q-Function
Exploration vs Exploitation
Discount Factor (Œ≥)
